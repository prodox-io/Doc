# üí° Ecosystem Introduction

## What makes the Prodox project different from other defi projects?

The Prodox (Prodox Protocol) system is a combination of blockchain decentralization and centralized defi products. The Prodox system records and creates a user account based on the user‚Äôs wallet account. That is, each user when interacting with Prodox‚Äôs system through ‚ÄúConnecting wallet‚Äù will automatically create an account. And this account only users can withdraw / deposit and use defi products of Prodox.

By combining the superiority of the Metamask wallet and Prodox‚Äôs system, Dox has created an efficient, fast, and secure dApp project. Not requiring users to confirm interactions with Smart Contract too much for each application makes customer accounts more secure than ever. In addition, the Prodox system will patch the security of exploiting bugs on smart contracts.

The Prodox system for users includes 3 main actions when interacting with Metamask

1- Sign, sign the user. (This action does not cost gas)

2- Withdraw and deposit.
