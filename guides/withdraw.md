Note: There will be cases where withdrawals fail for the following reasons:

* Gas fee is not enough, the system will report an error with gas charge up to 0.6 BNB
* While withdrawing, exit after confirming
* Withdrawing but the system failed to confirm.
* Withdrawing and transferring to another wallet

In these cases, there is a possibility that the amount in the SPOT wallet will be deducted. But our system will automatically post-check and refund to Spot wallet the amount deducted from 24h to 48h.
