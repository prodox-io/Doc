{% endhint %}

The Prodox P2P Trade system includes Market, My Orders, My Ads, and Post Ads.

To start using Prodox, there are a few requirements you must meet:

* Your Pi Wallet must be KYC-verified on the Pi Network (Mainnet)&#x20;
* You must provide information such as Email and Telegram ID (Chat with Prodox\_bot to get ID)
*   You must have a Metamask Address, which must be signed in on prodox.io/user&#x20;



**Market**: This is where you will find all the buying and selling demands being displayed.

**Post Ads:** You can post your buying or selling demand here. Prodox is currently testing the Pi-Dox pair with the Pi Network and BEP20 blockchain, so there will be two options:&#x20;

a) Buy Pi with DOX,

b) Sell Pi for DOX.

**My Ads:** This section will display your posted ads, including buying and selling demands.

If someone wants to buy Pi from your ad, the system will send you a Telegram message asking you to transfer the Pi to the buyer's wallet address with the correct amount. Once the transfer is complete, you can click the "Verify Transaction" button to release the buyer's locked DOX amount into your Spot Balance account, which you can then withdraw or swap for other tokens on the Binance platform.

If someone wants to sell Pi to you, the system will lock the corresponding amount of DOX and notify the seller to transfer Pi to you. Upon completion, the system will release the DOX amount to the seller.

**My Orders:** This section displays all of your buy and sell orders as you navigate the market.

Whether you are a Pi seller or buyer, the process is simple and secure. If you are a seller, you can sell Pi to anyone who wants to buy by clicking the "Sell" button. If you are a buyer, you can buy Pi from anyone who is selling by clicking the "Buy" button.
