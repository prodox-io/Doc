# ðŸ’° Pi Network - P2P Exchange

To start using Prodox, your Pi Wallet must be KYC-verified on the Pi Network Mainnet, you must provide your email and Telegram ID, and you must have a Metamask Address signed in on prodox.io/user.

Prodox P2P Trade system includes Market, My Orders, My Ads, and Post Ads. In the Market, you can find all the buying and selling demands displayed. In Post Ads, you can post your own buying or selling demand. My Ads displays all your posted ads, including both buying and selling.

If someone wants to buy a Pi from your ad, the system will send you a Telegram message asking for the transfer of the Pi to the buyer's wallet. After the transfer is complete, you can verify the transaction to release the buyer's locked DOX amount into your Spot Balance account, which you can then withdraw or swap on the Binance platform. If someone wants to sell a Pi to you, the system will lock the DOX amount and notify the seller to transfer the Pi to you. Upon completion, the system will release the DOX amount to the seller.

My Orders displays all your buy and sell orders as you navigate the market. Selling or buying Pi is simple and secure - just click the Sell or Buy button.
