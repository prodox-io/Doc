# ‚õè PRODDOX Mining

_To prepare for mining, user must log-in_ [_prodox.io/use_](https://prodox.io/user)_r then connect wallet, the system will automatically create your account._

## INTRO

Prodox Mining is based on BSC's blockchain and rewards tokens similar to POS methods. However, this will affect the miners who do not have enough DOX to stake and mine. Therefore, DOX chooses the mechanism according to the number of existing miners and divides it equally among everyone. Increasing mine speed depends on the network (Ref). DOX will require a minimum stake of 1 amount of DOX to ensure that the miner is a holder. This amount of Stake will increase over time. The mining rewards of Dox to miners will be maintained by the fees of the service that Dox provides. This balances out PRODOX's economic model

## OPERATION

Prodox Mining is divided into 12 cycles based on UTC+00 User when starting to mine $DOX will be based on 12 cycles.&#x20;

On the Mining Mobile App, there will be 2 main components of the mining section&#x20;

1- DOX Mining: This is the amount of DOX that has been mined and can be used&#x20;

2- Unconfirmed Mining: This is the amount of DOX that will be enjoyed at the end of a cycle.&#x20;

After each cycle, the Unconfirmed Balance will return to 0 and the DOX&#x20;

Mining Balance will get the amount of DOX mined.&#x20;

```
Mining Speed = Amount of Active Ref * Bonus Ref Speed + Mining System Base Speed
```

The system's base mining speed will be automatically adjusted to balance the financial system of the Prodox ecosystem.
